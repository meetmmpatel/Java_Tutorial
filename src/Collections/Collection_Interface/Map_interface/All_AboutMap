A Map is an object that maps keys to values.
A map cannot contain duplicate keys.


There are three main implementations of Map interfaces:

HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.


HashMap: it makes no guarantees concerning the order of iteration

TreeMap: It stores its elements in a red-black tree, orders
         its elements based on their values; it is substantially slower than HashMap.

LinkedHashMap: It orders its elements based on the order
        in which they were inserted into the set (insertion-order).

        It stores key-value pairs similar to HashMap.
        It contains only unique keys. Duplicate keys are not allowed.
        It may have one null key and multiple null values.
        It maintains the order of K,V pairs inserted to it
        by adding elements to internally managed doubly-linked list.
