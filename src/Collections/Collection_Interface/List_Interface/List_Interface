List Interface ...

1. ArrayList
2. LinkedList
3. Vector


1. ArrayList
  1.1 Is faster but not thread safe..
  1.2 does not maintain order of element inside the ArrayList.

  Index based – Elements can be randomly accessed using index positions. Index start with '0'.
  Dynamic resizing – ArrayList grows dynamically when more elements needs to be added than it’s current size.
  Non synchronized – ArrayList is not synchronized, by default. Programmer needs to use synchronized keyword appropiately or simply use Vector class.
  Duplicates allowed – We can add duplicate elements in arraylist. It is not possible in sets.

2. LinkedList
  2.1 Is maintain the insertion order of each element.
  2.2 Is implemented by node base algorithm.

3. Vector
  3.1 Is Thread safe..
