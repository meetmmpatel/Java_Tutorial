1. How to define the class in java .
  1. Variables  AKA Fields
  2. Methods  AKA Function
  3. Nested Class
  4. Anonymous Class

2. Constructor

   2.1. Every class must have at least one constructor.If there is no constructors for your class, the compiler will supply a default constructor(no-arg constructor).
   2.2. A constructor is used to construct an object.
   2.3  A constructor looks like a method and is sometimes called a constructor method.
   2.4  A constructor never returns a value
   2.5  A constructor always has the same name as the class.
   2.6  A constructor may have zero argument, in which case it is called a no-argument (or no-arg, for short) constructor.
   2.7  Constructor arguments can be used to initialize the fields in the object.

3. Defining Methods and Types of methods

4. Inheritance
    You extend a class by creating a new class.
    The former and the latter will then have a parent-child relationship.
    The original class is the parent class or the base class or the superclass.
    The new class is called a child class or a subclass or a derived class of the parent.
    The process of extending a class in object-oriented programming is called inheritance.
    In a subclass you can add new methods and new fields as well as override existing methods in the parent class to change their behaviors.
    Inheritance gives you the opportunity to add some functionality that does not exist in the original class.
    Inheritance can also change the behaviors of the existing class to better suit your needs.
    The subclass and the superclass has an "is-a" relationship.

5. Encapsulation

6. Abstraction

7. Polymorphism
   7.1 Method OverLoading
   7.2 Method OverRiding
