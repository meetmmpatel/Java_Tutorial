**`Design Patterns`**
This page has a list of popular design patterns. Instead of directly going to design patterns, it starts from core design principles which makes them easy to understand. Design principles 
and Design Patterns help us build extensible, scalable and maintainable applications.
As we all know, there can be multiple opinions and solutions for a specific pattern, I would like you to comment any suggestions and feedback. It would be great help for all of us.

**`~~Design Principles~~`**
`** 1. The Open Closed Principle**`
The article describes the open closed principle which is one of the object oriented design principles.
Don’t Repeat Yourself
The article explains and demonstrates don’t repeat yourself principle with the help of a real life example
`** 2.Single Responsibility Principle**`
The article explains the concept of single responsibility principle with the help of an example and how to identify and apply it to code
**Liskov Substitution Principle**
The article explains how violation of liskov substitution principle happens while designing applications and how to solve it using delegation
Aggregation Example
An example of aggregation association is provided with clear explaination of the concept
Composition Example
Concept of composition is explained using simple real life example along with corresponding java classes.




Design Pattern Implementations:
If you have git installed, then you can directly clone the design-patterns repository. I have kept code for all design patterns  

Go to your working directory and then follow below steps:


# **`Creational Patterns:`**
