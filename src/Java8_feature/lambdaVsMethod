Lambda expression vs method in Java

A method (or function) in Java has these main parts:
    1. Name
    2. Parameter list
    3. Body
    4. return type.

A lambda expression in Java has these main parts:
Lambda expression only has body and parameter list.
    1. No name – function is anonymous so we don’t care about the name
    2. Parameter list
    3. Body – This is the main part of the function.
    4. No return type – The java 8 compiler is able to infer the return type by
       checking the code. you need not to mention it explicitly.
