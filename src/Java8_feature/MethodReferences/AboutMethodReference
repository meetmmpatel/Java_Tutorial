Method reference is a shorthand notation of a
lambda expression to call a method. For example:
If your lambda expression is like this:

str -> System.out.println(str)

then you can replace it with a method reference like this:

System.out::println



Four types of method references
1. Method reference to an instance method of an object – object::instanceMethod
2. Method reference to a static method of a class – Class::staticMethod
3. Method reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object
   of a particular type – Class::instanceMethod
4. Method reference to a constructor – Class::new
