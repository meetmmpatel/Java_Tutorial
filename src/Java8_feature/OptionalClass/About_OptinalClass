This class is introduced
    to avoid NullPointerException that we frequently encounters
    if we do not perform null checks in our code.

Using this class we can easily check whether a variable has null
    value or not and by doing this we can avoid the NullPointerException.
    In this guide, we will see how to work with Optional class and the usage of
    various methods of this class.


    by using isPresent() method we can check whether the particular
    Optional object(or instance)
    is empty or no-empty.
    There is another method present in the Optional class,
     which only executes if the given Optional object is non-empty,
     the method is ifPresent().
