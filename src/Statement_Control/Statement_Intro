In programming, a statement is an instruction to do something.

It controls the sequence of execution of a program.

In Java, a statement is terminated with a semicolon
   and multiple statements can be written on a single line.

Example :

If block

if (booleanExpression) {
    statement (s)
} else {
    statement (s)
}


Multiple IF statements

if (booleanExpression1) {
    // statements
} else if (booleanExpression2) {
    // statements
}
...
else {
    // statements
}


An alternative to a series of else if is the switch statement.

The switch statement allows you to choose a block of statements
    to run from a selection of code, based on the return value of an expression.
The expression used in the switch statement must
    return an int or an enumerated value.

Switch statement

    switch (expression) {
    case value_1 :

         statement (s);
         break;
    case value_2 :
         statement (s);
         break;
      .
      .
      .
    case value_n :
         statement (s);
         break;
    default:
         statement (s);
    }



Loops introduction

1. While loop

while (booleanExpression) {
    statement (s)
}

2. Do while loop

do {
    statement (s)
} while (booleanExpression);

3. for loop

for ( init ; booleanExpression ; update ) {
    statement (s)
}

init is an initialization that will be performed before the first iteration.
booleanExpression is a boolean expression which will cause the
execution of statement(s) if it evaluates to true.

update is a statement that will be executed after the execution of the statement block.
init, expression, and update are optional.

The for statement will stop only if one of the following conditions is met:

booleanExpression evaluates to false.
A break or continue statement is executed.
A runtime error occurs.

4. For each loop

for(type itr-var : iterableObj) statement-block
